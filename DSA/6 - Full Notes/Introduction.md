# Introduction

**What are we studying?**
- Data Structures
- Abstract Data Types
- Algorithms
- Python

**Why are we studying this?**
- Data Structures and Abstract Data Types allow us to solve complex problems by abstracting details away and focusing on the big picture.
- An abstract datatype can be implemented in multiple ways across different programming languages, but we don't actually care how it's implemented but that we have it and we can use it.
- Algorithms are problem solving techniques; by seeing various different methods of solving a problem, we can take on other challenging problems via le- critical thinking.
- Python is very simple to use and is very interview friendly, which aligns with one my prospects as a potential software engineer / solutions architect / technical product manager.
