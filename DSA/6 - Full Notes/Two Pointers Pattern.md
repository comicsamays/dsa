**Where do we use this?**
- A sorted array or LinkedList, where we want to find a set of elements which fulfil a certain set of constraints

**How do we use this?**
- Set up 2 pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the list. Mathematically manipulate them to search for pairs of numbers you wish to compare for whatever reason
